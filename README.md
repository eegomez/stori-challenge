### For further iterations
- Use AWS RDS to store transactions, write a local implementation too.
- Change configuration instantiation since it is being instantiated every time the lambda function is called.
- Improve logging, differentiating between different criticality and add a middleware to handle it.
- Improve error handling, add a middleware.
- Add a local implementation for every repository.
- Use AWS Config and AWS Secrets to store config variables instead of getting from environment variables.
- Improve response message.
